            radicals in the body. Ginger appears to be highly effective against nausea.
            It may help relieve nausea and vomiting for people undergoing certain types
            of surgery. Ginger may play a role in weight loss, according to studies conducted
            in humans and animals. Ginger also helps in curing Vertigo, Morning Sickness.
